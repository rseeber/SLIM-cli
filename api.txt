slim <function name> [function option]

examples:
    slim addUser alice alice@math.com password123
    slim printDB
    slim getUsername [userID]

full list of available functions is in functions.txt

the cli will always output ascii. As such, wrappers have been placed around
some of the functions so that they will print a text output, rather than a data stream.
